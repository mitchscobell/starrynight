## What is this? ##
This is a revival of the original Starry Night screensaver from After Dark, released by Berkeley Systems in the 1990s. Starry night fills your screen with a glimmer of stars and buildings. This work is not related or affiliated with Berkeley Systems, this is a clone written completely from scratch.

## Installation Instructions ##
Installation is easy. Simply download the binary from the Downloads page, right click it, and select Install. Right click and select Test if you'd like to see it without installing it.

## Screenshot ##
Check out a screenshot of the screensaver in action below.

## Configuration ##
Configuration options allow the user to change the number of buildings in the sky and how tall they are. The red flasher can also be turned on and off. Advanced options can be changed directly in the starryn.ini file, though this is not officially supported nor recommended.
